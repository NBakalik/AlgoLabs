### QuickSort

The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma and can be run as follows:
- python merge_sort.py asc 1,2,56,45,-9,78,11
- java MergeSort.java desc 1,2,56,45,-9,78,11

asc - ascending 
desc - descending

Code must be able to sort ascending and descending.

The result should display:
- the name of the algorithm
- work time
- the number of comparison operations
- the number of swap operations
- sorted array

#### How to run:
1. Clone the repo. (git clone *url*)
2. Open cmd and enter the project folder
3. Compile .java files javac *.java
4. java QuickSort (sort order) (your array written through a comma without spaces)
